# Description

Our project is a web-based video recording application to help users practice before interviews, pitches, and any other forms of public speaking that they may have to do via Zoom. It utilizes React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, Node, face-api.js, Recharts, and D3.

# Workflow

Users can access the website by signing up with an email and password, or logging in if they already have an account. They will then be prompted with a tutorial screen which should dictate out the steps to follow to record their first video. After recording they will be taken to a results page which should render out total time spent in each of 7 emotional states (Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprised) as well as a transcript of their audio, their most frequently used word, metrics related to the filler words they used in their recording, and their vocal speed (words per second).
